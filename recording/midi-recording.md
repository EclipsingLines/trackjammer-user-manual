# MIDI Recording

**TrackJammer's** built-in MIDI recording system allows you to capture your live performances and evolving **Patterns** directly within the application. This guide covers how to set up, record, and play back your musical ideas.

## What is MIDI Recording?

MIDI recording captures the MIDI data generated by **TrackJammer**, including:

- Note and timing information from your **Patterns**.
- Real-time **Parameter** changes and automation.
- Live edits and spontaneous variations.

This allows you to preserve the nuances of a performance that go beyond a static **Pattern**.

## How to Record

### 1. Prepare for Recording

- **Set Up Your Session**: Ensure your **Tracks**, **Patterns**, and automation are ready.
- **Check Your MIDI Routing**: Verify that your MIDI outputs are correctly configured to your **DAW** or hardware.

### 2. Start Recording

- **Enable Recording**: Navigate to the **Recording Page** on the **Launchpad** and arm the recorder.
- **Press Play**: Start the sequencer. **TrackJammer** will begin capturing all outgoing MIDI data.

### 3. Stop Recording

- **Press Stop**: Stop the sequencer to end the recording.
- **Save the Recording**: You will be prompted to save the captured MIDI data as a new file.

## Playback and Verification

After recording, you can play back the captured MIDI file to verify its contents.

- **Load the File**: Import the MIDI file into your **DAW** or another MIDI-compatible application.
- **Play Back**: Listen to the recording to ensure it captured your performance as expected.

By using the MIDI recording feature, you can easily capture your creative process, document your musical ideas, and transfer your work to other platforms for further production.
