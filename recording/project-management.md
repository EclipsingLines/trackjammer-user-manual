# Project Management

Proper project management is key to an organized and efficient workflow. This guide explains how to save, load, and manage your **TrackJammer** projects.

## Understanding the Project Structure

**TrackJammer** uses a hierarchical structure to organize your work:

- **Project**: A **Project** is the top-level container, representing a complete song or musical piece. It holds all associated **Sessions**, **Patterns**, and settings.
- **Session**: A **Session** is a snapshot of your work at a particular point in time. Think of it as a version of your **Project**.
- **Quick Slots**: These are temporary storage locations for quickly saving and recalling the state of your sequencer. They are useful for live performance and experimentation.

## Saving and Loading

### Saving a Project

1. **Navigate to the Save Page**: Access the **Save Page** from the **Launchpad**.
2. **Select a Slot**: Choose an empty slot to save your **Project**.
3. **Name Your Project**: Give your **Project** a descriptive name.
4. **Save**: Confirm the save operation.

### Loading a Project

1. **Navigate to the Load Page**: Access the **Load Page** from the **Launchpad**.
2. **Select a Project**: Choose the **Project** you want to load.
3. **Load**: Confirm the load operation. This will replace the current **Session** with the loaded **Project**.

## Quick Slots

**Quick Slots** are designed for fast, temporary saves.

- **To Save to a Quick Slot**: Hold the **Save** button and press one of the eight **Quick Slot** buttons.
- **To Load from a Quick Slot**: Hold the **Load** button and press one of the eight **Quick Slot** buttons.

## Backup Strategies

It is always a good practice to back up your projects regularly.

- **Manual Backups**: Periodically copy your **Project** files to a separate hard drive or cloud storage service.
- **Version Control**: For advanced users, consider using a version control system like Git to track changes to your projects over time.

By following these project management principles, you can keep your work organized, secure, and ready for your next creative session.
