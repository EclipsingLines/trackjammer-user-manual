# Export Options

**TrackJammer** provides several options for exporting your work, allowing you to share your creations, collaborate with others, and integrate your sequences into a larger production workflow.

## Exporting MIDI Files

The most common way to export your work is as a standard MIDI file. This format is compatible with virtually all **DAWs** and other MIDI software.

### How to Export a MIDI File

1. **Select a Recording**: Choose the MIDI recording you want to export.
2. **Navigate to the Export Page**: Access the **Export Page** from the **Launchpad**.
3. **Choose a Format**: Select either **Type 0** or **Type 1** MIDI format.
    - **Type 0**: Merges all **Tracks** into a single MIDI track.
    - **Type 1**: Keeps each **Track** on a separate MIDI track.
4. **Export**: Confirm the export operation. The MIDI file will be saved to your computer.

## DAW Workflow Integration

Once you have exported a MIDI file, you can easily import it into your **DAW** for further editing, arranging, and mixing.

### Example Workflow: Ableton Live

1. **Export** your **Project** as a Type 1 MIDI file.
2. **Drag** the MIDI file into a new Ableton Live set.
3. **Assign** each MIDI track to a virtual instrument or external hardware synthesizer.
4. **Press Play** in Ableton Live to hear your **TrackJammer** sequence playing in your **DAW**.

From here, you can add audio effects, record vocals, and mix your track just as you would with any other project.

## Other Export Options

In addition to standard MIDI files, **TrackJammer** also supports other export options for specific workflows:

- **Ableton Live Set Export**: Directly export your **Project** as an Ableton Live set, with all **Tracks** and MIDI data pre-configured.
- **Audio Export**: Render your sequences as audio files, either as a stereo mixdown or as individual stems.

By mastering the export options in **TrackJammer**, you can seamlessly integrate your sequences into any production environment.
