## Our Philosophy on Recording

- **Performance Capture**: The recorder is recording ALL THE TIME from the moment you hit Start to the moment you hit Stop.
- **Record Everything**: The recorder outputs a single files with all 16 midi channels including all notes and events registered.

It is up to the user to filter out the sections and channels they don't need.

Individual recordings per device may be added at some point in the future.

The recordings are stored in the data folder next to app executable.

## Session Management System

- **Sessions**: A **Session** represents an individual work period with specific creative goals.
- **Quicksave**: Instantly capture the current state of the sequencer for quick recall.

Sessions are store on disk in the **data* folder next to the application's executable.

## Next Steps

Mastering recording and export will complete your **TrackJammer** workflow:

- **[Advanced Features](../advanced/)**: Combine recording with advanced compositional techniques.
- **[Live Performance](../performance/)**: Integrate recording with live performance workflows.
- **[Collaboration](../collaboration/)**: Use recording and export for effective musical collaboration.

Recording and export capabilities transform **TrackJammer** from a live instrument into a complete composition and production tool.
