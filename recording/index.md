- **Non-Destructive Workflow**: All recording operations preserve your original **Patterns** while creating new recorded versions, allowing you to experiment without losing your foundational work.
- **Professional Integration**: Export formats and recording quality meet professional standards, ensuring that your compositions integrate seamlessly with modern production workflows and software.
