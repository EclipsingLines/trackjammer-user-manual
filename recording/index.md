## Recording Philosophy

### Performance Capture

The recording system captures not just the notes and timing of your patterns, but also the nuanced performance elements including real-time parameter changes, live editing, and spontaneous variations that make each performance unique.

### Non-Destructive Workflow

All recording operations preserve your original patterns while creating new recorded versions, allowing you to experiment with different performance approaches without losing your foundational work.

### Professional Integration

Export formats and recording quality meet professional standards, ensuring your sequencer-based compositions integrate seamlessly with modern production workflows and software ecosystems.

## Core Recording Features
