# Getting Started

Get up and running with the {{ site.product_name }} quickly and easily. This section covers everything you need to know to install, configure, and start using the sequencer for your first music production session.

*Complete setup process from installation to first pattern creation*

## What You'll Learn

### Installation & Setup

- **[Installation →](installation.html)** - Download and install the sequencer on your system
- **[First Launch →](first-launch.html)** - Understanding the interface on startup
- **[Basic Operation →](basic-operation.html)** - Essential controls and workflow

### Essential Preparation

Before diving into advanced features, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Hardware Requirements Met** - Compatible system and MIDI interface
- ✅ **Software Installed** - Sequencer properly configured on your machine  
- ✅ **MIDI Connections** - Launchpad and sound sources connected
- ✅ **Basic Understanding** - Core concepts and interface familiarity

## Prerequisites

### Required Hardware

- Computer running Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
- USB port for MIDI controller connection
- MIDI interface or USB MIDI controller

### Recommended Hardware

- **Novation Launchpad Mini MK3** or **Launchpad X** for optimal experience
- **External synthesizer** or **software DAW** for sound generation
- **Audio interface** for professional audio quality

### No Prior Experience Needed

The sequencer is designed to be accessible to both beginners and experts. No previous experience with step sequencers or Euclidean rhythms is required.

## Common Setup Questions

### "Which Launchpad should I get?"

- **Launchpad Mini MK3**: Budget-friendly, full compatibility
- **Launchpad X**: Premium option with additional features and better build quality
- **Launchpad MK2 MK1**: Both are supported but present a limited pad color palette that might make performance chalenging.
- **Launchpad Pro**: Is supported but the additional button currently don't offer any extra functionality. Support for these will be added in a later update.
- **Other Controllers**: These are not supported at the moment.

### "Do I need external sound sources?"

The sequencer generates MIDI data only. You'll need:

- Hardware synthesizer, drum machine, or sampler
- Software DAW or virtual instruments (Windows currently does not support native virtual MIDI ports for cross aplication communicatio. Use a third party option like [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html))
- MIDI-to-audio conversion device

### "Can I use it without a Launchpad?"

Yes, but with limited functionality. The software interface provides all features, but the Launchpad integration is central to the intended workflow.

Other grid controllers might be implemented in the future.

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the getting started process:

- **[Explore Euclidean Rhythms →](../euclidean/)** - Understand the mathematical foundation
- **[Master the Launchpad →](../launchpad/)** - Hardware control techniques
- **[Advanced Pattern Editing →](../pattern-editor/)** - Detailed editing capabilities
