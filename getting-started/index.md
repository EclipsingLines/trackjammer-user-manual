*The complete setup process, from installation to creating your first **Pattern**.*

## What You'll Learn

### Installation & Setup

- **[Installation](installation.html)**: Download and install **TrackJammer** on your system.
- **[First Launch](first-launch.html)**: Understand the interface when you first open the application.
- **[Layout](layout.html)**: Learn the essential controls and workflow.

### Essential Preparation

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- ✅ **Hardware Requirements Met**: A compatible computer and **MIDI Device**.
- ✅ **Software Installed**: **TrackJammer** is properly installed on your machine.
- ✅ **MIDI Connections**: Your **Launchpad** and sound sources are connected.
- ✅ **Basic Understanding**: You are familiar with the core concepts and interface.

## Prerequisites

### Required Hardware

- A computer running Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+).
- A USB port for your **Launchpad** or other MIDI controller.
- A MIDI interface or a USB MIDI controller.

### Recommended Hardware

- **Novation Launchpad Mini MK3** or **Launchpad X** for the best experience.
- An external synthesizer or a software **DAW** to produce sound.
- An audio interface for professional sound quality.

### No Prior Experience Needed

**TrackJammer** is designed for both beginners and experts. No previous experience with step sequencers or Euclidean rhythms is required.

## Common Setup Questions

### Which Launchpad should I get?

- **Launchpad Mini MK3**: A budget-friendly option with full compatibility.
- **Launchpad X**: A premium option with additional features and better build quality.
- **Launchpad MK2/MK1**: Both are supported, but their limited color palettes can make performing challenging.
- **Launchpad Pro**: Supported, but the additional buttons do not currently offer extra functionality. Support will be added in a future update.
- **Other Controllers**: Not supported at this time.

### Do I need an external sound source?

Yes. **TrackJammer** generates MIDI data only. You will need one of the following to hear sound:

- A hardware synthesizer, drum machine, or sampler.
- A software **DAW** or virtual instruments. For Windows, you may need a third-party tool like [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) to route MIDI between applications.
- A MIDI-to-audio conversion device.

### Can I use it without a Launchpad?

Yes, but with limited functionality. It is not recommended with the current version. Support for other **Grid** controllers may be added in the future.

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the getting started process, you can:

- **Explore Euclidean Rhythms**: Understand the mathematical foundation of the sequencer.
- **Master the Launchpad**: Learn hardware control techniques.
- **Advanced Pattern Editing**: Discover detailed editing capabilities.
