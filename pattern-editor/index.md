# Pattern Editor

Dive deep into the heart of pattern creation with comprehensive editing tools that give you complete control over every aspect of your sequences. The pattern editor combines algorithmic generation with detailed manual control, allowing you to craft everything from simple rhythmic foundations to complex, evolving musical phrases.

## Editor Philosophy

### Precision Meets Creativity

The pattern editor balances mathematical precision with musical intuition, providing tools that enhance creativity rather than constrain it. Start with algorithmic foundations, then sculpt every detail to match your artistic vision.

### Non-Destructive Workflow

All editing operations preserve the underlying algorithmic structure while allowing complete customization. Return to algorithmic generation at any time or blend manual and automatic elements seamlessly.

### Real-Time Responsiveness

Changes take effect immediately during playback, allowing you to hear modifications in musical context and make adjustments that serve the overall composition.

## Core Editing Features

### **[Step Editor →](step-editor.html)**

Master the fundamental step-by-step editing interface, including step activation, timing adjustment, and basic parameter control for precise pattern crafting.

### **[Note Entry →](note-entry.html)**

Learn advanced techniques for melodic content creation, including chord entry, scale-based input, and harmonic sequence development.

### **[Velocity & Gate →](velocity-gate.html)**

Control the dynamics and articulation of your patterns through sophisticated velocity and gate length editing tools.

## Editing Workflow

### Layer-Based Approach

1. **Rhythmic Foundation** - Establish the basic timing structure using Euclidean algorithms
2. **Melodic Content** - Add note information and harmonic structure
3. **Dynamic Shaping** - Adjust velocity, gate length, and timing for musical expression
4. **Performance Polish** - Fine-tune details for live performance or recording

### Integration with Generation

- **Algorithmic Starting Points** - Use Euclidean and generative algorithms as creative foundations
- **Selective Override** - Manually adjust specific elements while preserving algorithmic coherence
- **Hybrid Patterns** - Combine multiple generation techniques with manual customization

## Advanced Editing Capabilities

### Multi-Step Operations

- **Range Selection** - Select and modify multiple steps simultaneously
- **Pattern Copying** - Duplicate sections within or between patterns
- **Transformation Functions** - Apply mathematical operations to entire pattern sections

### Parameter Linking

- **Velocity Curves** - Create smooth velocity transitions across multiple steps
- **Gate Relationships** - Link gate lengths for consistent articulation
- **Timing Offset** - Apply swing and groove templates to entire patterns

### Real-Time Modification

- **Live Parameter Tweaking** - Adjust parameters during playback for immediate feedback
- **Performance Editing** - Make dramatic changes during live performance
- **Undo/Redo System** - Experiment freely with comprehensive edit history

## Pattern Types and Applications

### Rhythmic Patterns

- **Drum Programming** - Create complex polyrhythmic foundations
- **Percussion Layers** - Build intricate percussion arrangements
- **Rhythmic Accents** - Add dynamic emphasis and groove elements

### Melodic Patterns

- **Bass Lines** - Program walking bass lines and rhythmic bass patterns
- **Lead Melodies** - Create evolving melodic sequences and hooks
- **Harmonic Progressions** - Build chord sequences and harmonic movement

### Hybrid Patterns

- **Melodic Percussion** - Combine rhythmic and tonal elements
- **Rhythmic Harmony** - Create chord patterns with rhythmic complexity
- **Generative Sequences** - Use algorithmic elements for evolving content

## Visual Editing Interface

### Grid-Based Design

The primary editing interface uses an intuitive grid where time flows horizontally and different parameters are represented vertically, providing immediate visual feedback about pattern structure.

### Color Coding System

- **Step States** - Active/inactive steps clearly distinguished
- **Parameter Values** - Velocity, gate, and other parameters shown through color intensity
- **Selection Feedback** - Selected elements highlighted for easy identification

### Real-Time Playback Indication

- **Playback Position** - Current step clearly marked during playback
- **Loop Boundaries** - Pattern start and end points visually indicated
- **Timing Relationships** - Step relationships and spacing immediately apparent

## Hardware Integration

### Launchpad Control

The pattern editor is fully integrated with Launchpad hardware, providing tactile control over all editing functions through the physical interface.

### Performance Editing

All editing functions remain accessible during live performance, allowing real-time pattern modification without stopping the music.

### Visual Feedback

Hardware LEDs provide immediate visual confirmation of all editing operations, keeping your eyes on the hardware rather than the screen.

## Creative Techniques

### Iterative Development

- **Start Simple** - Begin with basic patterns and add complexity gradually
- **Version Management** - Save pattern variations for comparison and selection
- **Experimentation** - Use undo/redo to explore creative alternatives safely

### Musical Context

- **Multi-Track Editing** - Consider how patterns interact across different tracks
- **Arrangement Perspective** - Edit patterns within the context of complete songs
- **Performance Considerations** - Design patterns that work well in live settings

## Next Steps

Master the pattern editor to unlock the sequencer's full creative potential:

- **[Sequencer Basics →](../sequencer/)** - Understanding fundamental sequencing concepts
- **[Track Management →](../tracks/)** - Coordinate patterns across multiple tracks
- **[Generative Features →](../generative/)** - Combine manual editing with algorithmic generation

The pattern editor is where musical ideas become reality. Master these tools to transform concepts into compelling musical sequences.
