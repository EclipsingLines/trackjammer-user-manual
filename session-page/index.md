# The Session Page

{% include launchpad-grid.html presets="null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null" show_top_session=true page=0 %}

The **Session Page** is where you manage your **Sessions**. From here, you can save, load, duplicate, and clear **Sessions**, allowing you to organize your work and manage different versions of your projects.

## Saving a session

- **To Save a Session**: hold down the **mute** pad button and tap on any pad on the main 8x8 area. The current session will be saved in that session slot and a **.json** file will be created inside the data folder.

## Selection a session slot

- **To Select a Session Slot**: just tap any pad inside the main 8x8 area.

## Loading a session

- **To Load a Session**: select a session slot and press the load button (up arrow, colored green), the screen will flash as confirmation and the session mode will close.

## Duplicating a session

- **To Duplicate a Session**: while a session is selected, hold the duplicate button (down arrow, colored cyan) and tap on the main 8x8 area.

## Clearing a session

- **To Clear a Session**: while a session is selected tap the clear button (left arrow, colored red) and that session and it's attached .json file will be cleared.

By using the **Session Page** effectively, you can keep your projects organized and easily switch between different ideas and arrangements.
