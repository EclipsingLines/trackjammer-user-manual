# TrackJammer User Manual

Welcome to the official user manual for **TrackJammer**, a powerful algorithmic step sequencer designed for electronic music production. This sequencer combines the mathematical elegance of Euclidean rhythms with a carefully curated set of stochastic generation tools, all controlled by the intuitive Novation **Launchpad**.

{% include full-launchpad.html %}

## What is TrackJammer?

**TrackJammer** is an advanced, **Pattern**-based sequencer that generates complex rhythms using Euclidean algorithms. Unlike traditional step sequencers that require you to program each **Step** individually, **TrackJammer** uses mathematical principles to create musically interesting **Patterns** automatically, while still giving you complete control over the details.

Built in the Godot game engine, it offers rock-solid timing, extensive MIDI capabilities, and seamless integration with the Novation **Launchpad**. Whether you're creating driving techno beats, complex polyrhythms, or experimental ambient textures, **TrackJammer** is designed to enhance your creative workflow.

## Key Features

- **Euclidean Rhythm Generation**: Generate mathematically perfect rhythmic **Patterns**. Specify the number of beats and **Pattern** length, and the sequencer does the rest.
- **Novation Launchpad Integration**: Full integration provides immediate, tactile control over your **Patterns**. The 8x8 **Grid** becomes your canvas for real-time editing.
- **7-Track Polyphonic Sequencing**: Seven independent **Tracks**, each with its own **MIDI Channel**, scale, and rhythm **Parameters**.
- **Generative Algorithms**: Advanced generative features let the sequencer suggest musical ideas while you maintain full creative control.
- **Advanced MIDI Control**: Comprehensive MIDI implementation with CC/NRPN automation, **Sub-tracks**, and slew rate automation.
- **Recording & Project Management**: A built-in MIDI recorder captures your performances in real-time, and the project management system lets you save and recall your work.
