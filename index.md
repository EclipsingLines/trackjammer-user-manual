## What is the {{ site.product_name }}?

The {{ site.product_name }} is an advanced pattern-based sequencer that generates complex rhythms using Euclidean algorithms. Unlike traditional step sequencers that require you to program each step individually, this sequencer uses mathematical principles to create musically interesting patterns automatically, while still giving you complete control over the details.

Built in the Godot game engine, it offers rock-solid timing, extensive MIDI capabilities, and seamless integration with the Novation Launchpad for hands-on control. Whether you're creating driving techno beats, complex polyrhythms, or experimental ambient textures, this sequencer adapts to your creative workflow.
