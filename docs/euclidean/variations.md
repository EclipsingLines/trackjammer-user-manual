# Pattern Variations

The Euclidean algorithm provides the foundation, but the sequencer offers several powerful variation techniques that transform basic patterns into rich, evolving rhythmic textures. These variations maintain the mathematical elegance while adding musical sophistication.

![Pattern Variations Overview](docs/img/pattern-variations-overview.jpg)
*Side-by-side comparison showing the same base pattern with different variation techniques applied*

## Rotation: Shifting the Downbeat

Rotation shifts the entire pattern around the circle, changing where the pattern begins without altering the beat distribution. This simple transformation can dramatically change a pattern's musical character.

### Understanding Rotation

**Mathematical Concept**: Rotation takes the generated Euclidean pattern and shifts all elements by a specified number of steps. A rotation of +1 moves every beat one step later; a rotation of -1 moves every beat one step earlier.

**Musical Impact**: Rotation changes which beat lands on the downbeat (step 1), fundamentally altering the pattern's rhythmic feel and its relationship to other tracks.

**Real-time Control**: Rotation can be adjusted during playback, allowing you to find the most musical starting point for any pattern.

### Practical Rotation Applications

![Rotation Examples](docs/img/rotation-examples.jpg)
*The same 5-beat, 16-step pattern shown with different rotation values*

**Finding the Groove**: The default Euclidean pattern might not place a beat on step 1. Use rotation to shift the pattern until a beat lands on the downbeat, creating a stronger foundation.

**Creating Variations**: Use different rotation values on the same basic pattern to create multiple pattern variations that maintain rhythmic coherence while providing arrangement diversity.

**Polyrhythmic Phasing**: Apply different rotation values to multiple tracks using the same pattern length to create phasing effects where patterns gradually move in and out of sync.

### Rotation Workflow

1. **Generate Base Pattern**: Start with a standard Euclidean pattern using your desired beats and length
2. **Listen for Downbeat**: Note whether the pattern has a strong beat on step 1
3. **Adjust Rotation**: Increase or decrease rotation until you find the most musical downbeat placement
4. **Save Variations**: Create multiple tracks with the same pattern but different rotations for arrangement flexibility

## Complement Mode: Inverting the Pattern

Complement mode flips the pattern, turning active steps into inactive steps and vice versa. This creates fascinating rhythmic inversions that maintain the original pattern's mathematical structure while providing completely different musical feels.

### How Complement Mode Works

**Pattern Inversion**: Every active step becomes inactive, and every inactive step becomes active. The total number of beats changes to (pattern length - original beats).

**Rhythmic Relationship**: The complement pattern locks perfectly with the original pattern - they never trigger simultaneously, creating interlocking rhythmic relationships.

**Musical Applications**: Complement patterns work excellently for call-and-response arrangements, counter-rhythms, and rhythmic counterpoint.

### Creative Uses for Complement Mode

**Rhythmic Counterpoint**: Use the original pattern on one track (kick drum) and its complement on another track (snare) to create interlocking rhythmic relationships where beats never coincide.

**Arrangement Dynamics**: Switch between original and complement patterns to create arrangement variations that maintain rhythmic continuity while changing the musical focus.

**Polyrhythmic Layering**: Combine complement patterns with rotation to create complex polyrhythmic relationships that maintain mathematical coherence.

### Complement Mode Workflow

1. **Create Base Pattern**: Generate your foundational Euclidean pattern
2. **Enable Complement**: Toggle complement mode to hear the inverted pattern
3. **Compare Musical Impact**: A/B between original and complement to determine which fits your musical vision
4. **Layer Strategically**: Use complement patterns on different tracks to create interlocking arrangements

## Deep Rhythm Algorithms

Deep rhythm mode uses advanced mathematical algorithms that go beyond basic Euclidean distribution, incorporating musicological research into traditional rhythm patterns from around the world.

### Toussaint Algorithms

**Academic Foundation**: The deep rhythm system implements algorithms developed by Godfried Toussaint, a computer scientist who studied the mathematical properties of world music rhythms.

**Cultural Accuracy**: These algorithms generate patterns that match traditional rhythms from Africa, Latin America, and other musical cultures, providing authentic rhythmic foundations.

**Enhanced Musicality**: Deep rhythms often sound more musical than pure Euclidean patterns because they incorporate centuries of human musical evolution.

### When to Use Deep Rhythms

**Cultural Authenticity**: When creating music inspired by traditional world music, deep rhythms provide mathematically accurate cultural patterns.

**Enhanced Musicality**: If standard Euclidean patterns feel too mechanical, deep rhythms often provide more organic, musical results.

**Complex Polyrhythms**: Deep rhythm algorithms excel at generating complex polyrhythmic patterns that maintain musical coherence.

### Deep Rhythm Workflow

1. **Start with Standard Euclidean**: Create your basic pattern using normal Euclidean generation
2. **Enable Deep Rhythm**: Toggle deep rhythm mode to apply enhanced algorithms
3. **Compare Results**: Listen to both versions to determine which provides better musical results
4. **Combine with Other Variations**: Deep rhythm works excellently with rotation and complement mode

## Accent Systems: Adding Musical Expression

The sequencer includes sophisticated accent systems that add musical expression and dynamic variation to Euclidean patterns without changing their basic rhythmic structure.

### Understanding Accent Algorithms

**Rhythmic Analysis**: The accent system analyzes generated patterns to identify strong and weak beats based on their position within the mathematical structure.

**Musical Intelligence**: Accents are applied according to musical principles, emphasizing downbeats, strong subdivisions, and rhythmically important positions.

**Multiple Accent Types**: The system can apply accents through velocity changes, gate length modification, note repetition, or harmonic variation.

### Accent Modes and Applications

**Velocity Accents**: Increase velocity on accented beats to create dynamic emphasis. Perfect for adding punch to kick drums and melodic sequences.

**Gate Accents**: Extend gate length on accented beats to create articulation variation. Excellent for bass lines and harmonic content.

**Repeat Accents**: Trigger multiple rapid notes on accented beats to create fills and intensity. Ideal for hi-hats and percussion elements.

**Harmonic Accents**: Change chord voicings or add harmony on accented beats to create harmonic interest and progression.

### Accent Configuration

**Accent Strength**: Control how dramatically accents affect the pattern, from subtle emphasis to extreme variation.

**Accent Density**: Set how many beats receive accent treatment, from sparse highlighting to dense accentuation.

**Syncopation Control**: Adjust whether accents follow traditional downbeat emphasis or create syncopated, off-beat emphasis.

## Combining Variation Techniques

The real power of the variation system emerges when combining multiple techniques to create rich, evolving patterns.

### Layered Variations

**Rotation + Complement**: Use rotated complement patterns to create sophisticated interlocking rhythms that phase in and out of alignment.

**Deep Rhythm + Accents**: Apply accent systems to deep rhythm patterns for culturally authentic patterns with enhanced musical expression.

**Multi-Track Coordination**: Apply different variation combinations across tracks to create complex arrangement relationships.

### Performance Applications

**Live Variation**: Use variation controls during performance to create builds, drops, and arrangement changes without stopping playback.

**Pattern Morphing**: Smoothly transition between different variation settings to create evolving arrangements and dynamic performance.

**Polyrhythmic Control**: Coordinate variations across multiple tracks to create and release polyrhythmic tension.

## Advanced Variation Techniques

### Rhythmic Phasing

**Steve Reich Influence**: Create phasing effects by using identical patterns with gradual rotation changes, inspired by minimalist composition techniques.

**Controlled Chaos**: Use systematic variation changes to create apparently random but actually controlled pattern evolution.

**Mathematical Relationships**: Exploit mathematical relationships between different variation settings to create patterns that align at specific intervals.

### Arrangement Integration

**Structural Variation**: Use different variation settings for different song sections (verse, chorus, bridge) while maintaining pattern coherence.

**Dynamic Builds**: Gradually introduce variations to create tension and release in your arrangements.

**Textural Layering**: Use variations to create rhythmic textures rather than individual drum parts, thinking orchestrally about pattern relationships.
