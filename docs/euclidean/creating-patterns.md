# Creating Patterns

Creating Euclidean patterns in the sequencer is remarkably simple yet incredibly powerful. This guide walks you through the pattern generation process, from basic parameter adjustment to advanced customization techniques.

## The Two-Parameter System

Euclidean pattern generation requires only two essential parameters, making it accessible while providing enormous creative range.

### Beats Parameter

The **Beats** parameter determines how many active steps (notes) will be placed in your pattern:

**Range**: 0 to current pattern length (maximum 32)
**Musical Impact**: More beats create denser, more active patterns; fewer beats create sparser, more spacious patterns
**Real-time Adjustment**: Changes take effect immediately, allowing you to hear results as you adjust

**Practical Examples**:

- **4 beats**: Classic house/techno four-on-the-floor when used with 16 steps
- **8 beats**: Steady eighth-note patterns with slight mathematical irregularities
- **11 beats**: Complex, dense patterns perfect for hi-hats and textural elements
- **3 beats**: Sparse, open patterns ideal for ambient textures

### Length Parameter

The **Length** parameter sets the total number of steps in the pattern:

**Range**: 1 to 32 steps
**Musical Impact**: Longer patterns create more complex relationships with other tracks; shorter patterns create tight, focused loops
**Metric Relationships**: 16 steps = one bar in 4/4 time, 12 steps = one bar in 3/4 time

**Common Lengths and Their Uses**:

- **16 steps**: Standard electronic music length, aligns with 4/4 time signature
- **12 steps**: Perfect for triple-meter feels and polyrhythmic relationships with 16-step patterns
- **8 steps**: Half-time feel, creates space and breathing room
- **24 steps**: Extended patterns for evolving sequences
- **Prime numbers** (13, 17, 19, 23): Create very long cycles before repeating relationships

## Step-by-Step Pattern Creation

*Step-by-step workflow showing the progression from parameter setting to final pattern*

### Starting Your First Pattern

1. **Select a Track**: Choose which track will carry your new pattern. Track 1 is a good starting point for melodic content.

2. **Set Pattern Length**: For your first pattern, try 16 steps to align with standard 4/4 time. This provides a familiar framework for experimentation.

3. **Choose Beat Count**: Start with 4 beats for a basic foundation rhythm, or try 6-7 beats for more complex patterns.

4. **Listen and Adjust**: Press Play to hear the generated pattern. The algorithm places beats optimally, but you can adjust beats or length to taste.

5. **Customize Individual Steps**: Once you have a basic pattern you like, toggle individual steps on or off to customize the rhythm further.

### Understanding the Generated Patterns

When you set beats and length parameters, the Euclidean algorithm calculates the optimal distribution:

**Mathematical Precision**: Beats are spaced as evenly as possible across the pattern length. For 5 beats in 16 steps, beats are placed roughly every 3.2 steps, creating natural rhythmic flow.

**Visual Feedback**: The pattern grid immediately updates to show the new pattern, with active steps highlighted in the track's color.

**Audio Feedback**: If playback is running, you hear the new pattern immediately, allowing instant evaluation of the rhythmic feel.

## Advanced Parameter Relationships

### Density Ratios and Musical Feel

The relationship between beats and length creates different musical densities and feels:

**Low Density (25% or less)**: Sparse patterns with lots of space. Try 3 beats in 16 steps for ambient textures.

**Medium Density (25-75%)**: Balanced patterns suitable for most musical applications. Examples: 4 beats in 16 steps, 7 beats in 12 steps.

**High Density (75% or more)**: Dense, driving patterns. Try 11 beats in 16 steps for intense hi-hat patterns.

### Polyrhythmic Relationships

Using different length patterns across tracks creates sophisticated polyrhythmic relationships:

![Polyrhythmic Examples](docs/img/polyrhythmic-examples.jpg)
*Multiple tracks with different pattern lengths creating complex rhythmic interactions*

**Simple Polyrhythms**: Track 1 with 16 steps, Track 2 with 12 steps creates a 4:3 polyrhythm that repeats every 48 steps.

**Complex Interactions**: Combining tracks with lengths like 16, 15, and 13 creates patterns that take hundreds of steps to align, generating constantly evolving arrangements.

**Musical Applications**: Use polyrhythms to create interest and evolution in looping patterns, preventing repetitive or static feels.

## Pattern Generation Strategies

### Building Arrangements Layer by Layer

**Foundation First**: Start with your most important rhythmic element (usually kick drum or bass). Use simple parameters like 4 beats in 16 steps.

**Add Complexity Gradually**: Layer additional tracks with complementary patterns. Try 6 beats in 16 steps for a secondary rhythmic element.

**Create Contrast**: Use different densities across tracks. Pair sparse patterns (3 beats in 16 steps) with dense ones (11 beats in 16 steps) for dynamic contrast.

**Establish Relationships**: Consider how pattern lengths interact. Mix standard 16-step patterns with 12-step or 15-step patterns for polyrhythmic interest.

### Genre-Specific Approaches

**House/Techno Production**:

- Kick: 4 beats in 16 steps (four-on-the-floor)
- Hi-hat: 8-11 beats in 16 steps (steady subdivision with variation)
- Melody: 5-7 beats in 16 steps (interesting syncopation)

**Ambient/Experimental**:

- Long patterns (24-32 steps) with few beats (2-5) for slowly evolving textures
- Prime number lengths for non-repeating relationships
- Very sparse density for spacious, contemplative feels

**Drum & Bass/Breakbeat**:

- Complex patterns with medium-high density (8-12 beats in 16 steps)
- Shorter pattern lengths (8-12 steps) for tight, focused loops
- High variation between tracks to create intricate rhythmic weaving

## Real-Time Pattern Adjustment

### Live Parameter Tweaking

One of the sequencer's most powerful features is real-time parameter adjustment during playback:

**Smooth Transitions**: Parameter changes take effect on the next pattern cycle, ensuring musical transitions without timing disruption.

**Performance Technique**: Practice adjusting parameters during playback to develop skills for live performance and creative exploration.

**A/B Comparison**: Quickly switch between different parameter settings to compare patterns and find the most musical options.

### Pattern Evolution Techniques

**Gradual Density Changes**: Slowly increase or decrease beat count to create builds and breakdowns. Start with 4 beats, gradually increase to 8, then back down.

**Length Morphing**: Change pattern length during playback to create polyrhythmic shifts and metric modulation effects.

**Cross-Track Coordination**: Adjust multiple tracks simultaneously to maintain musical relationships while changing overall arrangement density.

## Pattern Optimization and Refinement

### When to Use Manual Editing

While Euclidean generation provides excellent starting points, manual editing can perfect patterns:

**Fine-tuning**: Add or remove specific beats to better fit your musical vision while maintaining the algorithmic foundation.

**Musical Phrasing**: Adjust patterns to align with musical phrases, chord changes, or structural elements.

**Performance Dynamics**: Modify patterns for specific arrangement needs like builds, drops, or transitions.

### Balancing Algorithm and Intuition

**Start Algorithmic**: Use Euclidean generation to establish rhythmically sound foundations that avoid common manual programming mistakes.

**Refine Musically**: Make targeted manual adjustments to enhance musicality, phrasing, and arrangement fit.

**Maintain Core Structure**: Keep the algorithmic backbone while customizing surface details for optimal musical results.

## Common Pattern Creation Workflows

### The Explorer Approach

1. Set random or unusual beat/length combinations
2. Listen to generated patterns for inspiration
3. When you find interesting results, save them and build arrangements around them
4. Use unexpected patterns as starting points for creative development

### The Systematic Approach

1. Establish clear musical goals (genre, feel, energy level)
2. Choose parameters that align with your goals
3. Generate patterns methodically, testing musical fit
4. Refine successful patterns through manual editing
5. Build complete arrangements using proven pattern combinations

### The Performance Approach

1. Create multiple pattern variations using different parameters
2. Practice switching between variations during playback
3. Develop muscle memory for common parameter adjustments
4. Use real-time pattern generation as a performance instrument
