# Step Variations

**Please note: This feature is currently under development and is not yet available in the current version of TrackJammer.**

**Step Variations** will allow you to change how a **Step** is played based on its **Step Type**.

## Planned Features

### Monophonic

**Step Variations** will have no effect on monophonic **Steps**.

### Arpeggio

This will allow you to change the arpeggio **Pattern** for the **Step**.

### Chord / Strum

This will allow you to change the chord voicing for the **Step**.

## Next Steps

While this feature is being developed, you can explore other ways to add variation to your **Patterns**:

- **[Edit Track Parameters](../track-settings/index.html)**: Change **Track**-wide parameters like the root note, scale, or speed.
- **[Edit Step Velocity](notes-velocity.html)**: Change the intensity of the **Step**.
- **[Edit Step Gate](notes-gate.html)**: Adjust the duration of the **Step**.
