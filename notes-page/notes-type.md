# Step Type

{% include launchpad-grid.html presets="steps_4_floor,steps_4_floor_select,steps_empty,steps_empty,keyboard_prhy_notes,extra_row_note_type_2,save_slots" show_top=true page=2 subpage=2 %}

{% include step-selection-only-info.html %}

The step type subpage currently does the same as the [Note Selection](note-selection.html) subpage and might be removed in the future.

## Next Steps

Once you have selected the step type you might want to:

- **[Edit Track Parameters →](../track-settings/index.html)** - Change track wide parameters like root note, track scale or speed.
- **[Edit the Intensity of a Step →](../notes-page/notes-selection.html)** - Change the velocity of the step
- **[Edit the Duration of a Step →](../notes-page/notes-selection.html)** - Change the gate of a step
