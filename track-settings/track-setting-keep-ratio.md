# Keep Ratio

Binary selector.

Depending on the current **Keep Ratio** track setting the sequence will try to adapt the number of beats to try to keep the current rhythm when adjusting the sequence or will keep the number of beats intact.

## Keep Ratio ON

Adjusting a 4 on the floor 16 step sequence (16 Length - 4 Beats) to a 32 step with **Keep Ratio ON** will create a 32 step sequence with 8 beats, keeping the 4 on the floor feeling.

## Keep Ratio OFF

Adjusting a 4 on the floor 16 step sequence (16 Length - 4 Beats) to a 32 step with **Keep Ratio OFF** will create a 32 step sequence with 4 beats, halving the rhythms speed.
