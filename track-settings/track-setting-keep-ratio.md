# Keep Ratio

**Keep Ratio** is a binary selector that determines how the number of beats is adapted when you change the **Pattern Length**.

{% include launchpad-grid.html presets="track_params_none_r1,track_params_none_r2_3,track_params_none_r2,empty_row_step,empty_row_step,empty_row_step,extra_row_empty,save_slots" page=0 %}

### Keep Ratio ON

With **Keep Ratio ON**, the sequencer will try to adapt the number of beats to maintain the current rhythm.

- **Example**: Adjusting a 16-**Step** "four on the floor" **Pattern** (16 Length, 4 Beats) to 32 **Steps** will create a 32-**Step** sequence with 8 beats, preserving the feel.

### Keep Ratio OFF

With **Keep Ratio OFF**, the number of beats will remain the same when you change the **Pattern Length**.

- **Example**: Adjusting a 16-**Step** "four on the floor" **Pattern** (16 Length, 4 Beats) to 32 **Steps** will create a 32-**Step** sequence with 4 beats, halving the rhythm's speed.
