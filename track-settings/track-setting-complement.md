# Complement Mode

**Complement Mode** is a binary selector that inverts the output of the beat generation algorithm.

When **ON**, the generator will create **Steps** where there would normally be rests, and rests where there would normally be **Steps**. This is a powerful tool for quickly creating rhythmic variations and counter-melodies.
