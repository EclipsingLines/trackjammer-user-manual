# The Track Settings Page

{% include launchpad-grid.html presets="track_params_none_r1,track_params_none_r2,track_params_none_r2,empty_row_step,empty_row_step,empty_row_step,extra_row_empty,save_slots" show_top=true page=0 %}

The **Track Settings Page** allows you to set **Track**-wide **Parameters**. These settings have a direct effect on both the main **Track** and its **Sub-tracks**.

Some of these changes will not be audible immediately but will be applied during the next generative action (e.g., changing the **Pattern Length** or **Beats Amount**).

When you select a **Track Setting**, its name will scroll across the **Launchpad** **Grid**. The interface remains fully responsive during this time, and pressing any pad will stop the text.
