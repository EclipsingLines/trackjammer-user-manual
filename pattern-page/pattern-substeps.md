# Subteps

{% include launchpad-grid.html presets="steps_4_floor,steps_4_floor_select,steps_empty,steps_empty,substeps_default,steps_empty,extra_row_empty,save_slots" show_top=true page=1 subpage=3 %}

{% include step-selection-only-info.html %}

Subteps are microtiming steps, these allow you to play several notes on a single step (Step Repeat) or to offset a step hit from the main grid.

The value area provides a timeline of the substeps in the target step, if there's a currently selected step you can also add or remove subteps to this substep timeline.

## Next Steps

Once you've set up the Repeats and Offsets you can:

- **[Change Step Chance →](pattern-chance.html)** - Use the step play chance tools to further evolve your sequence
- **[Edit Step Notes →](../notes-page/index.html)** - Take full control of your sequence and shape it to your liking
