# Subteps

{% include launchpad-grid.html presets="empty_row_step,empty_row_step_last_8,empty_row,empty_row" %}

{% include step-selection-only-info.html %}

Subteps are microtiming steps, these allow you to play several notes on a single step (Step Repeat) or to offset a step hit from the main grid.

The value area provides a timeline of the substeps in the target step, if there's a currently selected step you can also add or remove subteps to this substep timeline.

{% include launchpad-grid.html presets="steps_4_floor_select,steps_4_floor,empty_row,empty_row" %}

## Next Steps

Once you've set up the Repeats and Offsets you can:

- **[Change Step Chance →](pattern-chance.html)** - Use the step play chance tools to further evolve your sequence
- **[Edit Step Notes →](../notes-page/index.md)** - Take full control of your sequence and shape it to your liking
