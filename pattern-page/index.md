# The Pattern Page

{% include full-launchpad.html page=1 %}

The **Pattern Page** is where you control the generative aspects of your sequence. On this page, you can modify **Parameters** that affect how the **Pattern** as a whole is played, allowing you to use algorithms to create and evolve your rhythms and melodies.

The following guides will help you get familiar with the generative functions of **TrackJammer**.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Generate Steps Algorithmically](pattern-beats.html)**: Use the procedural algorithm to generate a melody or rhythm **Pattern**.
- **[Adjust the Pattern Length](pattern-length.html)**: Change the number of **Steps** in a **Pattern** cycle, from 1 to 32.
- **[Edit Steps Manually](../notes-page/index.html)**: Take full control of your sequence and shape it to your liking.
