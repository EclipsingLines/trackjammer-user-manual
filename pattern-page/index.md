# Pattern page

{% include full-launchpad.html page=1 %}

The pattern page allows for changing the pattern hits and their overall behaviour.

While in this page you will modify parameters that will have a direct effect on how the pattern as a whole plays.

The following pages will help you get familiar with the generative functions of {{ site.product_name }}.

## Next Steps

Once you feel ready get started by:

- **[Generate Steps Algortyhmically →](pattern-beats.html)** - Use the procedural algorythm to generate a melody or rythm pattern
- **[Edit Steps manually →](../notes-page/index.html)** - Take full control of your sequence and shape it to your liking
- **[Adjusting the Pattern Length →](pattern-length.html)** - Change the number of steps for a pattern cycle, from 1 to 32
